= Project Euler



Different implementation of each problems from Euler Project
(https://projecteuler.net/) in different language:

 - Erlang
 - Elixir
 - Haskell
 - LISP like (clojure/racket)
 - OCaml
 - C
 - Prolog (swiprolog, mercury)

== Organization

 - by problem
 - by language

== Notes

I started to solve problems 4 or 5 years ago to learn Erlang and
Haskell.
